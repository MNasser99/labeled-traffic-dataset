# labeled-traffic-dataset
This image dataset was collected and labeled during my Bachelor's Project *Realtime AI Controlled Traffic Lights*. The raw images were gathered from different sources and labeled by me using [tzutalin's Labelimg tool](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg).

The dataset contains 140 labeled photos of vehicles in traffic in different conditions.

## Labels(Vehicle Types):
- "Car", id: 1
- "Motorcycle", id: 2
- "TukTuk", id: 3
- "Bus", id: 4
- "Truck", id: 5
